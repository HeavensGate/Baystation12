<i><strong>Welcome to Eden Outpost 13!</i></strong><br>

You are now awakening aboard the Eden Outpost 13, located in the Canus Nebula.
If you are a new transfer, please familiarize yourself with the various <a href="">regulations</a> aboard the station.
Recognize that Meta, "Griefing", and Out-of-Character activities or other immersion damaging actions are not permitted, and will be dealt with strictly.

<b>Warning: Lore files currently unavailable. Reverting to 'Bay' lore. Displaying notice</b>

We are currently undergoing a lore rewrite! For now, assume that Baystation-standard lore is in use, with the exception that you are not employed by Nanotrasen, but the mysterious non-human races entity "Eden" Tenatively, they allow humans on their station, though that may soon change. <i>Again, humans, especially those of poor character, or without description may be subject to additional scrutiny.</i>

<strong>Should you require assistance, simply enter the command 'adminhelp' to recieve aid from one of the station administrators. We are not unfriendly.</strong>
